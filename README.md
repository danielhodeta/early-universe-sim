# early-universe-sim

This is a simulation of the interaction between matter, antimatter and photons. It hopes to recreate a very basic image of the early universe in an attempt to understand the relative densities of matter, antimatter and photons needed for the current matter dominated universe to develop.

Usage:
  - python uni-sim.py [PARTICLE_NUMBER [MATTER_DENSITY ANTI_MATTER DENSITY PHOTON_DENSITY]]
  
Default values:
  - PARTICLE_NUMBER = 100
  - MATTER DENSITY = 1/3
  - ANTI_MATTER_DENSITY = 1/3
  - PHOTON_DENSITY = 1/3
